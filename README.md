My project name is HealthWise Recipe App.

Health.Wise is a Healthy eating recipe App that I decided to create as my first portfolio project in my Software Engineering learning journey.
The main aim to the health Recipe App is to solve the problem of finding, preparing, and understanding healthy recipes. The App aims to help health-conscious individuals, those with specific dietary needs, fitness enthusiasts, families, and busy professionals by providing easy access to nutritious recipes and meal planning tools.
